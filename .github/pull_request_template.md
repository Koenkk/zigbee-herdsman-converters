2. Go to the `public/images/devices` directory, *Add file* -> *Upload files*
  - Name the picture file exactly as the `model` of the device (e.g., `MODEL.png`)
3. Upload the files and press *Commit changes*
4. Press *Contribute* -> *Open pull request* -> update title/description -> *Create pull request*

**Make sure that:**
- The filename is `MODEL.png`
